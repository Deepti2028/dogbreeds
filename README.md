# dogbreeds
**PAW-NATION APP**
**Problem Statement:**
The complications faced by people owning pets: 
1.Not knowing how to care for them
2.Not having easy access to places which sell the necessities that are required to raise pets
3.Finding vets in the vicinity to care for their health  
4.Finding information regarding their grooming.
**Proposed Solution:**
To prevent dog owners from facing these problems, I wanted to create an app that can perform the below functionalities. 
**Functionality:**
1.To provide information about the breed of pet which mostly include:
        -Climatic conditions it can fit into
        -Its origin
        -Common traits
        - Shedding of fur(if any)
        -Life span
        -Friendliness with human beings.
2.To display information about nutrition and wellness of the breed.
3.To let the user know about the health risks associated with the breed.
4.To give grooming tips about their dog breeds.
5.To provide a section where you can access a veterinarian in and around the owners’ surroundings.
6.The app will also provide shopping links for all necessities of the dog breed(be it food, grooming essentials etc)
